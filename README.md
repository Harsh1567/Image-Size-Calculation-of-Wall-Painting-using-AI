# Image Size Calculation of Wall Painting using AI

This project leverages AI to detect wall paintings or objects and measure their dimensions, including width and height. The system utilizes ArUco markers for accurate dimension calculation.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to automate the measurement of wall paintings or objects using artificial intelligence. By employing ArUco markers, the system ensures precise detection and dimension calculation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- ArUco Marker Detection


## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes AI to detect wall paintings or objects in images.
- **Dimension Measurement:** Measures the width and height of detected objects.
- **ArUco Marker Integration:** Enhances accuracy with ArUco markers for reference.

## ArUco Marker

ArUco markers are a type of augmented reality marker that contains a pattern of black and white squares. These markers are used for image calibration, camera pose estimation, and, in this case, for accurate dimension calculation.

### ArUco Marker Definition

ArUco markers are visual markers that consist of a grid of black and white squares, allowing for easy detection and identification. Each marker contains a unique pattern, making them suitable for computer vision applications.
